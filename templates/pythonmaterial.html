        <h3>1. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</h3>
        <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Object-Oriented-Programming-768x593.png" height="400px" width="400px"><br>
		There are various advantages of object-oriented programming over procedural programming:
         
        <p>The Object-Oriented Programming methodology introduces the principles of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism through the use of classes and objects. The goal of OOP is to connect data and functions in order to increase code stability and security.

            You must be thoroughly clear with these concepts as they are the basis of the Java programming language.</p>

		<h3>2. System Design And Architecture</h3>
        <img src="https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/System-Design-and-architectect-768x718.png" height="400px" width="400px"><br>
        The most crucial parts of the software development process are software design and architecture. Any software developer, not just a Java developer, needs to be able to understand the broad picture and think through the challenge at hand, as well as choose the correct architecture and technology stack to create your program.
        <li>A proper system design keeps the project modular. It also allows for future adjustments to be made with ease. If your clientâ€™s requirements change, you can restructure a module rather than the entire project at any time. It allows you to detect mistakes in modules rather than the entire organized and complex code.</li>
        <li>A proper system design enhances the readability of the project. If a software project is passed from one developer to another, the new developer should be able to grasp the software just by reading the software design, which is the benefit of good software design.</li>

		<h3>3. JVM Internals</h3>
        You must devote time to learning JVM internals, such as what the various elements of JVM are and how they function, JIT, JVM options, garbage collections and collectors, and so on.
        <br>
        You can create both sturdy and high-performance Java applications if you know JVM well. You should also learn how to profile your Java application and how to identify performance bottlenecks, such as which objects are consuming the majority of your memory and CPUs.

		<h3>4. Java Testing Tools</h3>

        Java Testing Tools enable you to test your JSP pages and Web applications using an interface that does not require you to run your application in a web browser.
        They support a variety of test activities, including planning, requirements, building a build, testing, defect tracking, and analysis. Selenium and TestNG are two testing tools.
         You must have a good understanding of any one of these tools. They are of great help while testing your applications.
